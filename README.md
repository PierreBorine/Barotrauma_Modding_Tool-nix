# Mod Loader
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/themanyfaceddemon/Mod_Loader?label=release)

### Overview
`Mod Loader` - This tool is designed to ease the headache of managing modifications. It currently supports the following features:

- **Mod Conflict Detection**: Scans and identifies overwrites between mods to streamline conflict management.
- **Dependency-Aware Sorting**: Automatically sorts mods based on registered dependencies, ensuring they load in the correct order.
- **Easy Integration for Modders**: Simple setup that doesnâ€™t require interaction with the main repository. Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/themanyfaceddemon/Mod_Loader/blob/master/metadata%20example.xml) and in the [InternalLibrary directory](https://github.com/themanyfaceddemon/Mod_Loader/tree/master/Data/InternalLibrary) (except for `auto_pars` - there is no god there).

## TODO:
- [ ] Launch barotrauma from the launcher
- [x] More internal library so that at least popular and fresh mods are in normal order at the start (In a sense it is done, in https://github.com/themanyfaceddemon/Mod_Loader/pull/5 however it is best to finish it with a file)
- [x] Localization if hands reach
